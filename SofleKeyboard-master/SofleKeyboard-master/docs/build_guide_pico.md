The Sofle Pico is based largely on the Sofle V2 switch layout, and rebuilt specifically for the RP2040 Pico MCU. 

   - MX switch hotswap sockets (does _not_ support choc switches).
   - per-key RGB
   - 64x128 OLED's
   - through-hole or SMD diodes for easier soldering
   - RP2040 'drag and drop' flashing
   - VIA support
   - tenting puck mounting holes
   - patch bay for easy tinkering

Sofle Pico was contributed by [Ryan Neff](https://github.com/JellyTitan).
